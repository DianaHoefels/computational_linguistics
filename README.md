# Computational Linguistics

Welcome to the `computational_linguistics` repository! This project is dedicated to the fascinating world of computational linguistics and features a range of Python scripts and resources that dive deep into natural language processing (NLP), text analysis, and linguistic data manipulation.

## What's Inside

This repository is structured to provide a hands-on approach to computational linguistics:

- Scripts: Focused Python scripts demonstrating various NLP techniques such as tokenization, parsing, semantic analysis, and more.
- Datasets: Curated datasets to help you practice and implement algorithms that process and analyze linguistic data.
- Tutorials: Step-by-step guides to get you started with the basics of computational linguistics and advance your skills.
- References: A collection of papers, articles, and links to essential resources in the field of computational linguistics.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/DianaHoefels/computational_linguistics.git

# Navigate to the repository
cd computational_linguistics

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
